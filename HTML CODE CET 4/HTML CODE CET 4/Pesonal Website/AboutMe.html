         <h1> Katrina Ricci Batin</h1>
         <h3> And I am a Streamer!</h3>
         <p>
            <br>I'm a lowkey streamer, which means I may not have a massive following or flashy graphics, but I'm all about creating a chill and comfortable space for viewers to hang out and chat with me. </br>
            <br> I'm not here to compete for the most views or subscribers, but rather to share my passion for gaming, music, or whatever else I might be streaming that day. </br>
           <br> So whether you're here for the gameplay, the conversation, or just to relax and unwind, I'm happy to have you here and hope you enjoy the stream!</br>
